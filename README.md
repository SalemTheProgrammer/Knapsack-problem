## Introduction

The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a subset of items with maximum total value, given a constraint on the total weight. Various optimization techniques are explored in this repository to find efficient solutions to the Knapsack Problem.

## Implementations

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - File: [knapsack_dfs.py](knapsack_dfs.py)
   - Description: DFS-based solution exploring all possible combinations.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - File: [knapsack_dynamic_programming.py](knapsack_dynamic_programming.py)
   - Description: Solution using dynamic programming for optimization.

3. **Genetic Algorithm:**
   - File: [knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py](knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py)
   - Description: Optimization using a genetic algorithm.

## How to Use
